## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Python Implementation**

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   - Install [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv):  
     ```bash
     pip install pipenv
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dvf/blockchain.git
   cd blockchain
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

4. **Run the Blockchain Server**  
   ```bash
   pipenv run python blockchain.py
   ```
   Run additional instances with different ports:  
   ```bash
   pipenv run python blockchain.py -p 5001
   pipenv run python blockchain.py --port 5002
   ```

---

### **Docker Implementation**

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dvf/blockchain.git
   cd blockchain
   ```

2. Build the Docker container:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t blockchain .
   ```

3. Run the container:  
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 80:5000 blockchain
   ```

4. To add more instances, vary the public port number before the colon:  
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 81:5000 blockchain
   docker run --rm -p 82:5000 blockchain
   ```

### **C# Implementation**

For developers using **C#**, follow these steps:  

1. **Install Visual Studio**  
   Download the [free Visual Studio IDE (Community Edition)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/).  

2. **Open the Solution File**  
   Open `BlockChain.sln` using **File > Open > Project/Solution** in Visual Studio.  

3. **Set Up and Run**  
   - Right-click `BlockChain.Console` in Solution Explorer.  
   - Select **Set As Startup Project**.  
   - Press **F5** or click **Start** to run.  

The program runs in a console window and is controlled via HTTP, similar to the Python version.
